# BasicPatternDetectionImproved
An adaptive, feedforward neural network with variable layer sizes and lengths.

Tested with the following specifications: input = [[x], [y]], desired_output = (x > y) ? 1 : 0.

Included as well is a presentation on the mathematics of neural networks, and a more detailed derivation of the fundemental delta equations for backpropagation in a feedforward neural network.
