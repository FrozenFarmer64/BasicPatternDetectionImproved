# BasicPatternDetectionImproved
An adaptive, feedforward neural network with variable layer sizes and lengths.

Tested with the following specifications: input = [[x], [y]], desired_output = (x > y) ? 1 : 0.

Includes a presentation on the mathematics of neural networks, as well as a more detailed derivation of the fundemental delta equations for backpropagation in feedforward neural networks.
